  # NOTE:
  # - This file is meant to be used as a TEMPLATE.
  # - The generator will unwrap the top-level package key above and re-wrap it per-room.
  # - Tokens:
  #     room_slug          -> e.g. office / master_bathroom_toilet
  #     Room Friendly Name -> e.g. Office / Master Bathroom Toilet
  #
  # Optional blocks can be removed by the generator if you keep the markers:
  #   # --- BEGIN <block> ---   ...   # --- END <block> ---
  # Blocks: timers, night_window, brightness, fan_pct, fan_runon_minutes, lux, humidity, fan_on_delay

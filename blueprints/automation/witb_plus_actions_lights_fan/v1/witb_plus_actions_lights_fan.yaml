  description: >
    Version: 1.3

    Improvements over v1.2:
      - Fan run-on can start AFTER lights turn off (so the fan gets the full run-on time).
      - Optional startup cleanup: after HA restarts, if the room is vacant and auto-tags are ON,
        this can turn off lights/fan that were previously auto-controlled (helps when timer.finished
        would have occurred while HA was down).

    Room actions blueprint intended to pair with WITB+ v3.5 (mmWave + exit-latch).
    This blueprint keys off the room's *effective* occupancy sensor:

      - binary_sensor.<slug>_occupied_effective

    Behavior:
      - Occupied (ON for on_debounce): turns ON lights (with optional dark + day/night brightness rules)
        and optionally turns ON a fan (fan.* with optional percentage/preset) or on/off fan switches (switch.*).

      - Vacant:
          * Lights: turn OFF after lights_off_delay.
          * Fan: if fan_runon_timer is provided, starts a fan run-on timer (default: after lights turn off),
            then turns the fan OFF when the timer finishes (only if the room is still vacant).
            If no fan_runon_timer is provided, fan OFF falls back to lights_off_delay.

    Safety / "don't fight me" rules:
      - automation_override ON => do nothing (no ON, no OFF).
      - force_occupied OR manual_occupied ON => blocks vacancy OFF actions.
      - Auto-tag booleans (recommended): if provided, OFF actions only happen when the tag is ON.
        This prevents turning off lights/fans that were turned on manually.

    Night window:
      - night_start .. night_end is treated as the "night" period (supports crossing midnight).
      - fan_disable_during_night can prevent turning ON the fan during the night window while still
        allowing lights to turn on dimly.

# transit_helpers_package_template.yaml (rev 2026-02-26)
#
# Template package for a transit room (hallway/stairs/open connector).
#
# Why the dummy entities exist:
# Home Assistant frequently requires entity selectors to be non-empty if those selectors are used by state triggers.
# The dummy helpers provide a safe, per-room placeholder so the Transit Driver blueprint always validates
# even if you don't want keepalive or instant-off features for that room.
#
# Replace:
#   room_slug      -> hallway, stairs, upstairs_hall, etc.
#   Friendly Name  -> Hallway, Stairs, Upstairs Hall, etc.

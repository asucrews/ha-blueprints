room_witb:
  # WITB+ Core Package Template
  # Tokens: room_slug, Room Friendly Name
  #
  # This template covers ONLY the helpers consumed by the WITB+ v4.2 occupancy
  # blueprint. It does NOT include lights/fan/lux/humidity/night helpers —
  # those live in the separate room_witb_actions_package_template.yaml.
  #
  # Feature blocks (controlled by --no-X flags or per-room `no_X: true` in config):
  #   helpers     - required core: occupancy (input_boolean) + last_motion,
  #                 last_door (input_datetime) + exit_eval (timer)
  #   controls    - optional: override, force_occupied, manual_occupied (input_boolean)
  #   latched     - optional: latched debug helper (input_boolean)
  #   exit_close  - optional: last_exit_door (input_datetime) for "door closes
  #                 behind you" rooms (bedroom/garage style)
  #   failsafe    - optional: failsafe timer + failsafe_timeout input_number
  #   entry_gating - optional: entry_window_seconds input_number

  input_boolean:
    # NOTE: `initial` only sets the value on FIRST creation in the DB.
    # After that, HA restores the last known state from the recorder.

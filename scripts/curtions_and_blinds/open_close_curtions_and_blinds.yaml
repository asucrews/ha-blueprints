    ðŸ“© There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have
    found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST**
    Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use
    it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. ðŸ”— [koter84 Blueprint Update Script](https://github.com/koter84/HomeAssistant_Blueprints_Update/)

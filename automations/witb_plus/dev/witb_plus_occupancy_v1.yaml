    WIAB+ (Wasp in the Box Plus) is an enhanced automation blueprint designed
    for occupancy detection using multiple sensors, inspired by the "Wasp in the Box"
    concept.  The blueprint employs motion and door sensors to detect occupants (referred
    to as "wasps") within a defined space (the "box").  If motion is detected, indicating
    the presence of a "wasp," the state of the box is updated accordingly. The generated
    binary sensor reflects the presence or absence of a wasp in the box, enabling
    seamless integration with automation triggers.<br/> <br/>Assumptions:<br/> - Motion
    sensors are typically positioned to detect movement when someone walks into the
    room, triggering occupancy detection.<br/> - It is assumed that as long as the
    door to the designated area ("box") is closed, the room is considered occupied,
    influencing the automation''''s behavior.<br/> - Users are expected to configure
    motion and door sensors accurately to detect occupancy within the designated area.<br/>
    - The blueprint provides options to control smart light bulbs, light switches,
    and fans within the area based on occupancy detection.<br/> - Users are expected
    to create input_boolean entities for occupancy tracking and bypass control if
    they choose to utilize these features.<br/> - For bypass functionality, users
    need to manually integrate call service actions into their automations or methods
    to control devices when bypassing occupancy detection is required.<br/>

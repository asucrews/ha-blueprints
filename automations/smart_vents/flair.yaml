      description: >
        Does the room or area have only a door sensor or an occupancy helper? An occupancy helper is an input boolean used to track if a room is occupied. In most cases, multiple automations or scripts will track room occupancy. A helper makes it easier because you only need one place, versus many, to track this.<br/>
        <br/>Options:<br/>
          - Room Occupancy: Automation utilizes an occupancy helper to track if the room is occupied. This option simplifies tracking room occupancy by consolidating it into one place.<br/>
          - Door Sensor: Automation relies solely on a door sensor to determine occupancy. This option does not utilize an occupancy helper, requiring individual automations or scripts to track room occupancy.<br/>
        <br/>Default value: Door Sensor Only.<br/>

        Specify the delay time, in seconds, for the door sensor to register an open event after detecting movement.  This option helps reduce false events triggered by activities like door openings and closings or shared spaces with multiple occupants.<br/>

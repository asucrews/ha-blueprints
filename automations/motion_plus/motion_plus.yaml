            Select an input boolean entity to serve as an occupancy helper within the designated.  To utilize this function, create an input_boolean helper entity in your Home Assistant configuration or UI.<br/>
            The occupancy helper can be used to track the overall occupancy status and coordinate actions based on occupancy detection.  Can be utilized for more advanced automation scenarios where additional logic based on occupancy status is required.<br/>
            <br/>Default value: 'input_boolean.none'. Only change if you intend to use this field and this input is optional.<br/>

          description: >
            Select the bypass mode to control how the automation handles bypass events.  This input is optional and allows you to customize the behavior of the automation based on your preferences and requirements.<br/>
            Bypass mode determines whether the automation should ignore occupancy detection temporarily.  Depening on the option you select you need to create a input_boolean for bypass and timer helper.<br/>
            <br/>Options:<br/>
              - No Bypass: Automation operates normally without bypassing occupancy detection.<br/>
              - Bypass No Auto OFF: Automation temporarily ignores occupancy detection until manually turned off. To use this option, create an input_boolean helper entity for bypass control.<br/>
              - Bypass Auto OFF: Automation temporarily ignores occupancy detection and automatically reverts to normal operation after a specified time. To use this option, create input_boolean and timer helper entities for bypass control and automatic timer management.<br/>
            <br/>Default value: No Bypass. Only change if you intend to use this field and this input is optional.<br/>

          description: >
            Select an input boolean entity to serve as a bypass helper within the designated area.  The bypass helper enables manual control over bypass events, allowing users to override occupancy detection when necessary.<br/>
            To enable bypass for a WIAB room, manually integrate call service actions into your automations or methods.  For instance, you might configure a double-tap action on the light switch to set the bypass helper.<br/>
            To utilize this function, create an input_boolean helper entity in your Home Assistant configuration or UI.<br/>
            <br/>Default value: 'input_boolean.none'. Only change if you intend to use this field and this input is optional.<br/>

          description: >
            Specify the action to be taken after the bypass auto-off timer finishes counting down.  This determines whether the automation should turn off lights or other devices when the bypass timer expires.<br/>
            <br/>Options:<br/>
            - Turn Off: Automatically turns off lights or devices when the bypass timer expires.<br/>
            - Do Nothing: Leaves lights or devices unchanged after the bypass timer expires.<br/>
